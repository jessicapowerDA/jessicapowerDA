## Hello,

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building my career in Fraud Analytics
- I Know how to use SQL, Excel, Power BI, Python, Machine learning & AI.
- I have years of experience working in the fraud department for a major bank
- I have a business accounting diploma
- Currently trying to earn my CFE with the association of certified fraud examiners (ACFE)

  I want to build a career in fraud prevention as I have developed a growing passion for it ever since I started working as a bank teller in 2019 and helped prevent all kinds of Scams, Identity Theft and Money Lauundering.
  With technology constantly growing and changing I have decided to use my expertise, passion and analytics to continue my work in fraud prevention.
  I am excited to see where my career brings me
